## Font-Letter Generator GAN Project 
### For defending a bachelor's thesis at Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University
Project achievement: Implemented and trained deep learning model on handwriting image data where
the model generates English alphabet letter images which are specifically unique.
During the project, take into account the estimation of results.


For Ubuntu [Tested] <br>

  ```
**Step 3:** <br>
  Download image data from this link: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasqazwsxedc/alphabet-characters-fonts-dataset) <br>    <br>
**Step 4:**
  Set folders path and dataset properly in **main_code.ipynb** and run cells <br>  <br> 
**Step Optional:**
   For now, if interested in generating a specific letter font you have to  change the dataset directory.
